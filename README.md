# Calendar Application

## Project Overview
The Calendar Application is a web-based tool designed to help users manage their schedules effectively. It allows users to create, view, and manage events, providing a user-friendly interface for organizing their time. The application is built using React, leveraging modern web development practices and responsive design principles to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices.

## Key Features
- **Event Management**: View events with specific start and end times.
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically detects overlapping events and displays them in a dedicated section within the event modal.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear and organized calendar view with color-coded events for easy identification.
- **Accessibility**: Follows best practices for accessibility, ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Built with React.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local state management.
- **Styling**: Styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Data Structure**: Events are stored in a structured format, allowing for easy retrieval and manipulation.

   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
